# Contributing

Thanks for looking at OhmTabs. Two ground rules keep this project safe to
work on:

1. **Never load, reload or test the native plugin in the compositor you are
   sitting in.** Use the nested rig in `docs/QUALIFICATION.md` (a second
   Hyprland on a headless output). A native crash there ends a sandbox, not
   your session.
2. **Never condition `hl.plugin.load()` on whether the plugin is already
   loaded.** Read `docs/AUTOLOAD.md` before touching `native/autoload.lua`
   or `helpers/ohmtabs-autoload`.

## Agent and automation guardrails

These rules keep the 2026-09-15 startup failure fixed. They live here in
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (not in a root-level agent-instruction file) because the
marketplace installs the repository contents as the plugin checkout, and
root-level agent files can be auto-interpreted as trusted instructions.

- Read `docs/AUTOLOAD.md` and `SYSTEM-BREAKING-BUG.md` before touching
  anything that loads the native plugin.
- The installed copy under `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/tech.loopedmatrix.ohmtabs`
  is the operator's live plugin. Syncing it is the operator's call.
- Never `cat >` over a loaded `.so`; building writes a new inode, which is
  safe while an old copy is mapped.
- Do not `pkill -f <pattern>` from an agent shell (it matches the agent's own
  command line); kill by PID.

## Layout

See the table in `README.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Pure logic lives in
`OhmTabsModel.js` so it can be tested with Node; the QML files are thin.

## Building

```sh
make -C native/ohmtabs CXX=g++       # against the installed hyprland headers
tests/run.sh                          # offline suite
```

Building writes a new `ohmtabs.so` inode; a compositor that has the old file
mapped keeps running. Load the new file into the nested session with
`hyprctl -i <nested sig> plugin load …`.

## Tests

- `tests/run.sh` must pass before every commit (it is what CI runs).
- Native or shell behaviour changes need the relevant nested suite
  (`g0-nested.sh`, `g1-service-nested.sh`, `apps-nested.sh`,
  `scenarios-nested.sh`); record the run in `docs/QUALIFICATION.md` with the
  exact Hyprland build.
- New protocol fields go into `docs/PROTOCOL.md` and all three codecs
  (C++, JS, Python) plus their tests.

## Style

- Match the surrounding code. C++ follows the Hyprland plugin style
  (`.clang-format` from upstream); QML/JS use two-space indent and ES5-style
  JavaScript in `OhmTabsModel.js` (it runs in Quickshell's engine).
- User-facing text is plain: no dispatcher syntax, no internal workspace
  names, no success messages before the state change is observed.
- Never build shell commands from window titles or classes; never resolve
  an action against the focused window.

## Pull requests

Describe what changed and how it was tested (which nested suite, which
Hyprland build). Keep the upstream base and the patch footprint visible:
if you touch a file derived from Hyprbars, note the behavioural change in
`docs/UPSTREAM.md`.

## Release distribution

Releases include the directory submission/update stage in
[docs/DISTRIBUTION.md](docs/DISTRIBUTION.md). Preserve preview qualifications
and record each target's receipt and pending review separately.
